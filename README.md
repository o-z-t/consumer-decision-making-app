# consumer-decision-making-app
Consumer oriented mobile app to help people make more informed decisions on purchases. 
The big idea is that people would be able to scan their reciepts, the app would extract price, date, and product data.
Along with location information and other user contributions to the general database, it could tell the user another
store would have saved them money, or it could give a heads up for when they would buy something again. The general database would 
be stripped of personal information, and the each user's purchase history would be private of course. In that sense it's no different than
most shopping type apps, it's just that this would use the same information to benefit the consumer, not the producer.
It would ideally increase competition among retailers, thus driving the prices of products down.
